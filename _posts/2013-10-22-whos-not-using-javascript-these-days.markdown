Here is [some interesting research](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/10/21/how-many-people-are-missing-out-on-javascript-enhancement/) by the UK Government's digital office, which found that 1.1% of their visitors weren't seeing JS run, but only 0.2% were due to JavaScript being disabled or unsupported. The other 0.9% (4.5x more) had JS enabled, but it wasn't running because of firewalls, faulty browser extensions, network timeouts, and more.

It's a timely call for progressive enhancement at a point where more sites are going JavaScript-only.
