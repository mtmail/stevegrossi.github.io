From Michael Bernstein's excellent talk [Distributed Systems Archeology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp08EmQtP44):

> Suddenly we are distributed systems engineers, when in reality we were distributed systems egnineers all the time.
>
> The most fruitful work that we have achieved in the field of computer science is a direct result of the application of resources toward the ends of furthering and better understanding humanity.
