While some of [what's in here](https://github.com/csswizardry/CSS-Guidelines) boils down to personal preference, there's enough in Harry's guide that speaks to my own experience that I'll be paying close attention to those that don't (yet). It's also a great example of how [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), and [BEM](http://bem.info/method/) best practices can work together.
