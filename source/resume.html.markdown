I'm a full-stack developer 

## Experience

- **Developer at Alldayeveryday (January 2013–Present)**  
  
  Since joining Allday, I’ve worked across the stack developing, marking up, and deploying everything from Tumblr themes to full-featured sites. I'm proudest thus far of being the primary developer behind Styld.by, a responsive, international site and CMS that we built for Gap. I also pushed for and helped build a company wiki which, while it's still catching on, helps the tech and strategy teams share information and resources about projects and technologies.

- **Senior Coordinator of Online Projects at Cancer*Care* (July 2009–January 2013)**  

  - I joined CancerCare as a designer and, paired with a senior developer for the first two years, redesigned and rebuilt cancercare.org, which receives over 500,000 visits each year. I guided the design, championing the user experience through a number of stakeholder reviews in addition to learning Ruby on Rails and building a CMS for CancerCare’s non-technical content editors. By rewriting the markup to be semantic and sensible, I helped increase search-engine referrals by 40%.
  - When my partner moved on, I became the sole designer and developer at CancerCare, responsible for building and maintaining all of their websites, like the new, responsive cancercarecopay.org.
  - I also code CancerCare’s email newsletter which reaches about 70,000 people.
  - I've managed two contract coders brought on to help with big projects.



- **Freelancer Web Developer** (2008–present)  
  
  My personal mission as a freelancer is to banish the concept of a “webmaster”. I set all of my clients up with heavily customized WordPress installations, leveraging the custom post type and menu APIs to empower them to manage their content with ease. Since I moonlight these jobs, I prefer smaller projects for artists, churches, and local businesses.

## Skills

- Test-Driven Ruby and Rails with RSpec
- Git and Gitflow
- Jekyll and Middleman to make even simple static sites maintainable
- semantic, accessible HTML
- object-oriented CSS, with Sass to keep it clear and consistent
- modular, loosely-coupled JavaScript, saved as CoffeeScript when appropriate

## Schooling

**New York University, College of Arts and Sciences**

Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy & Comparative Literature, magna cum laude. Philosophy taught me how to think logically and clearly, which I’m thankful for as a coder, and CompLit showed me how to think critically about anything, which I depend on as a designer.
