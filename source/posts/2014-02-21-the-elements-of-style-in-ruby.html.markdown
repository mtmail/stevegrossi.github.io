Bozhidar Batsov, the man behind [Ruby's most popular style guide][1], has begun an excellent series of posts called ["The Elements of Style in Ruby"][2]. The series explores some thorny matters of taste, clarity, and performance about which anyone interested in writing the best Ruby code should at least have an opinion.

And if you agree with Batsov or just want to take his word on it, he's released a gem called [Rubocop][3] which will scan your project directory for improper or inconsistent style.
