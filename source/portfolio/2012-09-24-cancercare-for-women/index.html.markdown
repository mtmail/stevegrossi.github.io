[CancerCareforWomen.org](http://cancercareforwomen.org) is a portal to CancerCare's information and support services tailored to women facing any diagnosis. Jacqueline Zahora handled the content and project management, and I designed and built the site on the WordPress platform.

This has been the most technically sophisticated project I've done for CancerCare since the redesign of [cancercare.org](http://www.cancercare.org). In order for cancercareforwomen.org to have access to the most up-to-date information from CancerCare's database, I built an <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> to cancercare.org, allowing the former to populate its pages with information from the latter with no need for duplication.
