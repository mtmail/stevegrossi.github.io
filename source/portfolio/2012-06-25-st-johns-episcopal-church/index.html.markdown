<figcaption>When viewing the site on a small-screen (like this iPhone), the navigation menu hides itself behind a simple "Menu" link, so you can browse the site without having to scroll past the menu on each page.</figcaption>

St. John's Episcopal Church had a Google calendar, some photo albums, and listings in various directories, but needed a single place where members and potential members could come for information. After discovering their needs, I built [stjohnshf.org](http://stjohnshf.org) on the WordPress platform so they could log in to edit or update pages without any technical ability (because the internet is for everyone). I integrated their Google calendar, made it easy to generate online photo albums by uploading photos, built the site in a search-engine-friendly way so that anyone looking for them (or a church like theirs) can find them easily.
