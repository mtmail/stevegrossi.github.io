As part of Cancer<i>Care</i>'s web team, I took part in the in-house revamping of cancercare.org. We began the 20-month process by gathering feedback from the organization's social workers and visitors. This led to several key goals in the project: make navigation simpler, improve usability through design, and implement a custom content management system to make updates across the site easier and more consistent.
