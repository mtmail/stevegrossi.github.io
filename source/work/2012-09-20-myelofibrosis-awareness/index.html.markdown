Coinciding with the inaugural Myelofibrosis Awareness Day in September 2012, the MPN Coalition launched [myelofibrosisawareness.org](http://myelofibrosisawareness.org). The site is a central hub for information about the month’s events, diagnosis-related information, and access to support services. A leading member of the coalition, Cancer<i>Care</i> had full technical responsibility for the site. Jacqueline Zahora played the role of content strategist and project manager, and I handled design and development.

Beginning this project on a short timescale, I upgraded CancerCare’s single WordPress installation to a multi-site network, allowing me to quickly get new sites up and running. This let Jackie immediately get to work on content while I planned the visual and technical aspects of the site. Visually, the color scheme derives from the coalition’s Empower Toolkit, a resource created to help people host their own Awareness Day events, and for the font I selected Open Sans, a legible sans-serif with friendly details created by Steve Matteson for Google. I'm especially appreciative of Modern Tribe's [The Events Calendar plugin](http://tri.be/wordpress-events-calendar/), which powers the events section.
