  <figcaption>Lungcancer.org was built mobile-first, with an emphasis on clean, sturdy typography for small screens and a layout that grows more complex on larger screens.</figcaption>

One of my last projects at Cancer<i>Care</i> was the relaunch of lungcancer.org. We'd done a lot of good work on cancercare.org, and it was time to bring its sister site up to the same level. Many of our goals were the same as for the rebuild of cancercare.org: have content pulled from a common database for easy updating, replace stock photos with our own images of staff and clients, and bring simplicity and focus to the sitemap and navigation. To that last point, the old site has five primary sections, About Us, Get Help, Lung Cancer 101, In the News, and Support Us. Except they weren't all primary. Most of the site's content was in the second and third sections listed or, confusingly, both. So we organized the new site into two primary, clearly-named sections: Find Information and Find Support, corresponding to the two main ways the site can be helpful to visitors.

As with cancercare.org before it, I rebuilt the old PHP template-based site with Ruby on Rails for rapid development and so they could share functionality. Google site search also greatly improved search results. And we even experimented, successfully I think, with some changes we hoped to port to cancercare.org: a typographic upgrade from Arial to Open Sans, a flexible-width layout for screens large and small, and Retina-ready icon fonts in lieu of low-resolution images for the social media icons.

Much credit goes to Jacqueline Zahora who expertly managed the content and the project itself (including difficult developers like me), and everyone at Cancer<i>Care</i> who provided feedback.
