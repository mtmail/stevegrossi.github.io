Like many artists, Julia had a portfolio website from a few years ago that she couldn't update. She'd also started a separate blog and discovered how convenient it is to use software like WordPress to keep her readers up to date about her work. So she brought me in to do the sensible thing: integrate her portfolio and blog into one cohesive website that she could easily update on her own. Now, whether it's a new blog post, gallery, press mention, book, or link, Julia can update her site using the WordPress platform she was already familiar with from blogging. On the front end, I designed a brand new minimalist layout that really lets her work stand out, and even better, it uses the latest responsive design techniques to make the layout adapt to different devices, so it's optimized whether you're viewing it on a desktop monitor or iPhone.
