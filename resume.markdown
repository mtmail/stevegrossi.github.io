## Developer at Lessonly <span class="subhead">(November 2014–Present)</span>

I recently joined [Lessonly](http://www.lessonly.com) as a full-stack developer to help build the simplest, most impactful learning software out there.

## Developer at Alldayeveryday <span class="subhead">(January 2013–November 2014)</span>

At Allday, I worked across the stack developing and deploying everything from Tumblr themes to global media platforms. I also championed the creation of a company wiki which helps the tech and strategy teams share information and resources about projects and technologies. Highlights include:

- Lead developer for styld-by.com, a responsive, internationalized publishing platform for Gap's global media team
- Sole developer for Gap's 2013 online holiday gift guide, an editorialized shopping experience backed by a custom CMS built on Rails 
- Co-developer of an HTML5 mobile web app for Nike's Global Media Summit using Rails and Backbone. Features included a live calendar, photo stream, and chat.

## Senior Coordinator of Online Projects at Cancer*Care* <span class="subhead">(July 2009–January 2013)</span>

While at Cancer*Care* I helped lead and develop a brand new cancercare.org, both the front-end user experience and a custom CMS built on Rails.

- By rewriting cancercare.org's HTML for to be semantic and sensible, I helped increase search-engine referrals by 40%.
- Design and WordPress development of many of Cancer*Care*'s supplemental sites including cancercarecopay.org, cancercareforwomen.org, and myelofibrosisawareness.org.
- I managed two contract developers brought on to help with big projects.

## In the Community

- Since moving to Indianapolis, I've been an active member of the Indy.rb meetup group, and enjoy learning from and helping others at our monthly Hack Nights.
- I volunteer with Railsbridge Indy, teaching Ruby and Rails chiefly to folks underrepresented in the industry.

## New York University

B.A. in Philosophy & Comparative Literature, <i lang="la" title="with high honors">magna cum laude</i>. Philosophy taught me how to break complex issues into clear, logical components, which as a developer helps me get things done. And CompLit taught me how to think critically and productively about anything, which helps me get things done *right*.
